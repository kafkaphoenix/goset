# Goset

## Description
Goset is a Go library that provides a simple and efficient way to work with [generic](https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics) sets. It allows you to create, manipulate, and perform operations on sets. It offers both a concurrent and no concurrent implementation, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

## Features
- Create sets of [comparable](https://go.dev/blog/comparable) elements.
- Perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

## Example
Run the example code:
```sh
make example
```
This will run the example code in `example/main.go`, which demonstrates how to create and manipulate sets using the library.
